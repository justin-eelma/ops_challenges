# Ops Challenges

- What is this repo all about?

 A collection of Ops Challenges from Ops 201 at Code Fellows Bootcamp
 
- Why are you learning these skills?

Mainly, to become familiar with scripting and automating tasks within Linux and Windows command prompts. 

- What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?

Ops 201 covered programming fundamentals such as setting variables, functions, arrays, and loops. We also learned how to access information by using commands within our scripts, such as specifications, ip addresses, and system tasks.  

- What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?

My favorite challenge was also the most frustrating one to work on, Challenge 6. This challenge asked us to scan a directory, detect if the system had a certain file or folder, if not, then create one. It was extremely satisfying to see the end result because it was my first time using an array, loop, and condition, all in one script. 

- How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?
 
We can uses shell scripts to automate tasks and simplify large datasets to find information quickly. 

- What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?
 
The log retrieval script could get trimmed down. I feel like I should be using 'grep' more in that script.  

- What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?

I would like to explore conditions a little bit more. I could see the potential of making powerly efficient scripts through conditional formatting.
